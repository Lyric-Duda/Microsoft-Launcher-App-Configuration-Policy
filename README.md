# Microsoft Launcher App Configuration Policy Information

This is my Microsoft Launcher layout for Fully Managed Company Owned Devices

# JSON Configuration Information

## Microsoft Launcher Custom Template

I took the template that you can download from intune when you make a "App Configuration Policy" for "Microsoft Launcher" and structured it to fill "Set Allow-Listed Applications" and "Home Screen App Order" easier

## Microsoft Launcher

These JSON files are structured to

* Set the devices Wallpaper
    + User change disabled
* Enables the M365 Feed
    + User change disabled
* Set the "Home Screen Grid Size" to 5x5
* Define the "Set Allow-Listed Applications"
* Define the "Home Screen App Order"
* Disable the dock
    + User change disabled
* Set’s the search bar at the top of the screen
    + User change disabled
* Home screen web browser
    + Microsoft Launcher Google Chrome sets Google Chrome as the home screen browser
    + Microsoft Launcher Microsoft Edge sets Microsoft Edge as the home screen browser
